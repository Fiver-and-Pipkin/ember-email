Min-E-Mail
========

by Debbie Cravey

Min-E-Mail is a minimalist email client using EmberJS. It does not actually send and receive messages, but rather, demonstrates proof-of-concept by saving data to Local Storage. This app offers the user the ability to display email in folders and add, edit, and create new messages.

Installation
------------

Install Min-E-Mail by first cloning the repository.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/dacravey/ember-email.git

```

Must run web server to view. For Mac, in the terminal, enter

```
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer.

```
On Windows, you can download Mongoose, copy it to your project folder, and double-click it to launch a server and open your page in the browser.

* Then in your web browser, simply pull up the program by navigating to localhost:8000. (or whatever port number you chose.)
